        <p>"I'm not trying to repeat the sagas.  I make my own stories and I'm very obseesed with not being nostalgic because i think 90% of the world is too nostalgic.  They don't have the courage to face the present and make stories that are relevant today.  I want people to do more of that."  -Bjork</p>
       
		

		<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/102375-the-first-person-who-having-enclosed-a-plot-of-land">
		“The first person who, having enclosed a plot of land, took it into his head to say this is mine and found people simple enough to believe him was the true founder of civil society. What crimes, wars, murders, what miseries and horrors would the human race have been spared, had some one pulled up the stakes or filled in the ditch and cried out to his fellow men: "Do not listen to this imposter. You are lost if you forget that the fruits of the earth belong to all and the earth to no one!”
