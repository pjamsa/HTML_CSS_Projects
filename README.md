<h1>HTML And CSS Projects</h1>

These are some basic projects I have created with HTML and CSS.

<h2>Projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Movie Theater Showtimes Page</li>
  <li>Animal Shelter Adoption Page</li>
  <li>Launch Page for Personal Portfolio</li>
  <li>Music Home Page</li>
</ul>

<h2>Movie Theater Showtimes Page</h2>
In this project I used HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap library to create a home page for a Movie Theater to display showtimes.

<h2>Animal Shelter Adoption Page</h2>
This project features HTML and CSS to create a mock website for an animal shelter looking for humans to adopt cute furry creatures.  

<h2>Personal Portfolio</h2> 
This project features HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional portfolio to display skills and projects to employers.

<h2>Music Page</h2>
I created a personal site with HTML and CSS where fans can stream my music as well as stay updated on news concerning my music.
